- **User Initiates Login**: The user makes a request to access a resource through the client app (e.g., a web app).
    
- **Redirect to Authorization Server**: The client app redirects the user to the authorization server (like Google, Facebook, etc.), asking for permission to access certain resources on the user's behalf. This usually includes a _scope_ of permissions and the _client ID_.
    
- **User Consents and Authorizes**: The authorization server asks the user to log in if they’re not already authenticated and then requests consent to authorize the requested permissions.
    
- **Authorization Code Issued (for Authorization Code Flow)**: If the user consents, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client app with an authorization code.
    
- **Client Requests Access Token**: The client app exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a back-channel request to the authorization server, providing the code along with its own client credentials.
    
- **Access Token Issued**: If the request is valid, the authorization server issues an access token (and sometimes a refresh token) to the client app.
    
- **Access Resource**: The client app uses the access token to authenticate API requests to the resource server. The access token is used to access protected resources as long as it remains valid.
    
- **Caching and Refreshing**: The client app may store the access token temporarily (often in a secure local cache) to reuse it until it expires. When the access token expires, if a refresh token is available, the app can request a new access token without needing to redirect the user again.

Overall  Oauth flow in different scenario
OAuth 2.0 offers different flows to suit various types of applications and security needs. Here’s a summary of the main OAuth flows, their steps, and common use cases:

### 1. **Authorization Code Flow**

**Purpose**: Most secure flow; ideal for web apps with a back-end server.

**Steps**:
   1. The client app redirects the user to the authorization server for permission.
   2. If the user approves, the authorization server redirects back with an *authorization code*.
   3. The client app exchanges the authorization code for an *access token* by sending a secure back-channel request to the authorization server.
   4. The client uses the access token to access protected resources.

**Use Case**: 
   - Used by server-side web applications where the client has a secure back-end (e.g., web apps that need to make secure API calls on behalf of users).

**Security Benefits**: 
   - The access token is never exposed to the browser or front-end directly, reducing the risk of interception.

### 2. **Implicit Flow**

**Purpose**: Designed for applications that cannot securely store a client secret, like single-page apps (SPAs).

**Steps**:
   1. The client app redirects the user to the authorization server for permission.
   2. If approved, the authorization server immediately issues an *access token* and redirects the user back with it.
   3. The client uses the access token to access resources directly.

**Use Case**:
   - Used by single-page applications (JavaScript web apps) and mobile apps where secure storage of a client secret is not possible.

**Security Limitations**:
   - Since the access token is directly exposed in the front-end, it’s considered less secure. The Implicit Flow is gradually being replaced by the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**.

### 3. **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**

**Purpose**: A more secure variant of the Authorization Code Flow; suitable for public clients, especially mobile and single-page applications.

**Steps**:
   1. The client generates a random string called a *code verifier* and derives a *code challenge* from it.
   2. The client redirects the user to the authorization server, including the code challenge.
   3. The authorization server issues an *authorization code* upon approval and redirects the user back.
   4. The client exchanges the authorization code for an *access token* and sends the code verifier to prove it initiated the request.
   5. The client uses the access token to access resources.

**Use Case**:
   - Commonly used by mobile apps and SPAs as it provides stronger security without requiring a client secret.

**Security Benefits**:
   - Prevents interception and reuse of the authorization code by attackers due to the dynamic code verifier.

### 4. **Client Credentials Flow**

**Purpose**: Used for server-to-server communication where user authorization is not required.

**Steps**:
   1. The client (e.g., a server) directly requests an *access token* from the authorization server using its client credentials (client ID and secret).
   2. The authorization server issues the access token.
   3. The client uses the access token to access resources on behalf of itself, not an end user.

**Use Case**:
   - Ideal for machine-to-machine communication, where one server needs to access resources on another server’s behalf (e.g., an API gateway accessing a microservice).

**Security Aspects**:
   - Typically used in highly controlled environments where secure storage of client secrets is ensured.

---

### 5. **Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow (Password Flow)**

**Purpose**: Simplest but least secure flow; should only be used when other flows are not feasible.

**Steps**:
   1. The user provides their username and password directly to the client app.
   2. The client app exchanges these credentials for an *access token*.
   3. The client uses the access token to access resources.

**Use Case**:
   - Primarily used for legacy applications or trusted clients, like apps created by the same organization as the authorization server.

**Security Limitations**:
   - Not recommended for third-party apps as it requires direct handling of user credentials, making it highly vulnerable to interception if not secured properly.

### Summary Table

| Flow                         | Best For                        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization Code Flow**  | Web apps with back-end servers  | Secure, uses back-channel to exchange authorization code for access token.  |
| **Implicit Flow**            | Single-page apps (SPAs)        | Fast, but less secure. No back-end required.                               |
| **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** | Mobile apps, SPAs          | More secure, no client secret needed, adds PKCE for additional security.   |
| **Client Credentials Flow**  | Server-to-server communication | Machine-to-machine access, no user context.                                |
| **Password Flow**            | Legacy or highly trusted apps  | Not recommended; requires user to share credentials directly with the app.  |

For most modern apps, **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** is recommended for enhanced security, especially for public clients like mobile apps and SPAs.
