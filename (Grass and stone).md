i dig through the cross space trying to get closer
shoveled my way into my own demise
i pick up the cobwebs round every corners till i swan i right at my mind

And my father once told me I ain't no quitter 
So i picked up the liquor back up from the shelf
I follow you sideways six ft down where i live 
I am sure we will catch up in hell
laa laaaa laaaaaiiii .....in the mean time
laaa laaaa laaaaaiii... i am alone 
so i stare at the ceiling 
missing you dearly 
till i am cold wrap up into grass and stone

and when i meet my maker
