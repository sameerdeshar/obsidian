### How DNS Resolution Works

1. **Browser Starts a Request**:
   - When you type a domain name, like `samirdeshar.com.np`, into your browser, the browser needs the IP address of the server hosting the website. To find it, your computer starts a DNS resolution process.

2. **Querying a DNS Resolver**:
   - Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, often provided by your ISP or a public DNS service like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8). This resolver will perform the necessary steps to find the IP address.

3. **Asking the Root Servers**:
   - The DNS resolver begins by querying the DNS "root servers." These servers don’t store specific domain information but know where to find the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers, like `.com` or `.np` (for Nepal).
   - In this case, the root servers will direct the resolver to the `.np` TLD servers.

4. **Querying the `.np` TLD Servers**:
   - The root servers respond with a list of `.np` TLD servers, which are responsible for handling all `.np` domains. 
   - The resolver then queries one of these `.np` servers, asking for the nameservers of `samirdeshar.com.np`.

5. **Finding the Authoritative DNS Servers**:
   - The `.np` TLD server replies with the DNS servers that are authoritative for `samirdeshar.com.np`. In this example, these are Cloudflare's DNS servers, which are responsible for providing the final answer.

6. **Getting the IP Address**:
   - The resolver now queries one of the authoritative Cloudflare DNS servers, asking for the IP address of `samirdeshar.com.np`.
   - The Cloudflare server responds with the IP addresses, like `172.66.44.181`, which corresponds to the website.

7. **Connecting to the Website**:
   - The DNS resolver sends this IP address back to your browser, which then uses it to connect directly to the server at `172.66.44.181` and load the website content.

### What `dig +trace` Shows

The `dig +trace` command shows each step in the DNS resolution path, from root servers to the authoritative server:

- **Root Servers**: The first part of the output shows which root server was queried and which `.np` TLD servers it provided in response.
- **`.np` TLD Servers**: The next section shows the `.np` servers directing the resolver to the authoritative Cloudflare DNS servers.
- **Authoritative Server**: Finally, the output shows Cloudflare’s authoritative server providing the IP addresses of `samirdeshar.com.np`.

### Example Commands:

To run a trace and check the response from each server:

- **Trace the path**:
  ```bash
  dig +trace samirdeshar.com.np
  ```

- **Querying Root DNS servers**:
  ```bash
  dig @a.root-servers.net samirdeshar.com.np
  ```

- **Querying the Authoritative Servers directly**:
  ```bash
  dig @jobs.ns.cloudflare.com samirdeshar.com.np
  ```

- **Clean output (just the IP)**:
  ```bash
  dig @jobs.ns.cloudflare.com samirdeshar.com.np +short
  ```

In summary, DNS resolution goes through these steps: **Root Servers** → **.np TLD Servers** → **Authoritative Cloudflare Servers** → **IP Address for the website**.
