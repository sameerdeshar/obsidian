On February 13th, 2024, Microsoft announced a Microsoft Outlook RCE & credential leak vulnerability with the assigned CVE of [CVE-2024-21413](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21413) (Moniker Link). Haifei Li of Check Point Research is credited with [discovering the vulnerability](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/the-risks-of-the-monikerlink-bug-in-microsoft-outlook-and-the-big-picture/).


### Moniker Vulnerability

- A **moniker vulnerability** is a security flaw where attackers abuse these moniker links to execute malicious code or commands without the user’s knowledge.
- For example, an attacker could send a Word document containing a hidden moniker link that automatically triggers a download of malicious software when opened.
- This can happen because certain moniker links can bypass normal security prompts, giving attackers a way to run commands without alerting the user.
### Why It’s a Problem

Moniker vulnerabilities can be dangerous because they allow attackers to run malicious code with minimal user interaction. Microsoft frequently patches these types of vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access and protect users from potential attacks.
