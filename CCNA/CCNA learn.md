**Network Interface Card (NIC)** - A NIC physically connects the end device to the network.
**Physical Port** - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking device.
**Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.
*Note: The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.*
