### 1. Fine-Tune the WAF DDoS Policy

- **Threshold Adjustment**: Set DDoS thresholds to detect abnormal spikes more precisely. Lowering these thresholds can help the WAF recognize legitimate requests by separating traffic patterns of genuine users from high-volume, rapid requests typical of DDoS.
- **Behavioral DoS Profile**: Enable behavioral analytics within the DoS profile to differentiate between unusual traffic (spikes) and normal usage. This can adaptively filter out high-risk traffic based on behavior, rather than volume alone.

### 2. AFM Integration for Specific IP Blocking

If you have AFM (Advanced Firewall Manager), use it to create specific blocking rules for the offending IPs:

- **Create Dynamic IP Block Lists**: Configure an IP block list that AFM can update in real-time with the IPs flagged by the WAF or other detection sources.
- **Use Address Lists**: Add detected IPs into an address list and apply firewall rules to reject traffic from these IPs only.
- **Automated DDoS Protection**: Integrate AFM with the WAF to dynamically adjust the blocked IP list when a DDoS is detected, allowing legitimate traffic to bypass restrictions.
### 4. Rate Limiting

Use rate-limiting settings per IP to prevent overload from single or multiple IPs, protecting legitimate users from the high volume of requests that accompany DDoS events.



- **Low Sensitivity**: F5 is relaxed, allowing more traffic before deciding itâ€™s an attack. Best for environments with a lot of legitimate traffic.
    
- **Medium Sensitivity**: A balanced approach. It lets through moderate spikes but still watches for suspicious activity.
    
- **High Sensitivity**: F5 is strict and quickly flags unusual traffic as an attack. Ideal for high-security needs but might block some legitimate traffic if it spikes suddenly.

### IP Intelligence Configuration in F5 BIG-IP

**Overview:**
In BIG-IP Network Firewall and AFM, you can set up policies to manage traffic based on an IP intelligence database that identifies known malicious or questionable IP addresses. This allows for automatic handling of traffic from these sources to prevent attacks.

#### IP Intelligence Database
- Contains IP addresses with a questionable reputation, typically due to malicious activities or being associated with proxies or infected systems.
- Maintained online by a third-party provider.

#### Key Features
- **Control Actions**: Specify actions for denylist (blacklist) categories within a policy, including default actions and logging.
- **Global/Specific Application**: Apply IP intelligence policies globally or to specific virtual servers or route domains.

#### Steps to Configure IP Intelligence

1. **Create a Feed List**:
   - Navigate to **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Feed Lists**.
   - Click **Create** and name your feed list.
   - Add feed URLs (HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP) and specify list types (deny/allow).
   - Set the polling interval and finish creating the feed list.

2. **Configure an IP Intelligence Policy**:
   - Go to **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies** and select **Create**.
   - Name the policy and add feed lists.
   - Set the default action (Accept or Drop) for IP addresses not categorized in the feed list.
   - Configure logging actions for denylist and acceptlist matches.

3. **Customize Denylist Actions**:
   - In the policy, configure actions for specific denylist categories, overriding default settings if needed.

4. **Assign the Policy**:
   - **Globally**: Go to **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies** and select the policy for global application.
   - **To a Virtual Server**: Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**, select the desired virtual server, enable IP intelligence, and choose the policy.
   - **To a Route Domain**: Go to **Network > Route Domains**, select the domain, and apply the policy.
